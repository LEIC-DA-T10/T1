# [Logística Urbana para Entrega de Mercadorias](https://github.com/LEIC-DA-T10/T1/blob/main/DA%202021-22%20Trabalho%20Pr%C3%A1tico%201.pdf)
> First delivery for the subject "Developing Algorithms"
> 
## Execution instructions
> Compile the program using a normal C++ compiler (We use GCC).

```bash
gcc applicationController.cpp -Wall -o executable_name
```
> Using the created executable file whats left is to execute it.

```bash
./executable_name
```

After executing the file the user shoud be presented with a intuitive menu.
> The menu allows for various operations, but its important to remind of the following

 - Our appplication allows the user to test the same segment of the datasets in the 3 scenarios without the need to exit the execution.
 - The user can reload the datasets without the need to exit the app.
 - It is possible to retrieve some of the execution data by printing it to a file.
 - Some scenarios have more than one execution option.
 - After one execution the loaded datasets will not be afected.

More information can be found in the [report](link to insert later).

## Dependencies
> In case of missing the input files please check the [data/input](https://github.com/LEIC-DA-T10/T1/tree/main/data/input) folder both files should be present.

> The output files should be located in your local version of this project in the data/output folder some examples of past executions can be found for reference [here](https://github.com/LEIC-DA-T10/T1/tree/main/data/output).

All of the required files for the program executution are present in this repository no futher instalation should be necessary. Excluding of course the usual C/C++ language and respective compilers.

We make use of the provided datasets to change them visit [data/input](https://github.com/LEIC-DA-T10/T1/tree/main/data/input) in your local folders.
